# MakerCAD
Free CAD software by Makers for Makers.

Read more about MakerCAD and why I made it [on my blog](https://www.digitaltorque.com/articles/makercad-1/)

## The Vision ##
Build a software based CAD suite that provides:

1. Relative geometry construction (build features relative to what you've already built)
2. Parametric modeling (model based on modifiable parameters)
3. Collaboration on modeling (git pull requests)
4. Version control (also via git)

Long term goals:
1. Build a code editor UI (a la OpenSCAD)
2. Build a UI for non-coders

## Using MakerCAD ##

Start by creating an instance of MakerCad:

```bash
cad := makercad.NewMakerCad()
```

### Creating Primitives ###

#### Plane ####
Planes can be used for creating sketches or placing primitives
```go
MyTopPlane := sketcher.NewPlaneParametersFromVectors(
    sketcher.NewVectorFromValues(0, 0, 0),  // Location (origin for the plane)
    sketcher.NewVectorFromValues(0, 0, 1),  // Normal (Z) direction vector
    sketcher.NewVectorFromValues(1, 0, 0),  // X Direction vector
)
```

A plane can also be created from a face of a model

```go
sketcher.NewPlaneParametersFromCoordinateSystem(aFace.Plane())
```

There are also some origin planes predefined in MakerCAD:
```go
type MakerCad struct {
	sketches    []*Sketch
	FrontPlane  *sketcher.PlaneParameters
	BackPlane   *sketcher.PlaneParameters
	TopPlane    *sketcher.PlaneParameters
	BottomPlane *sketcher.PlaneParameters
	LeftPlane   *sketcher.PlaneParameters
	RightPlane  *sketcher.PlaneParameters
}
```

#### Rectangular Cuboid ####
Provide a plane to locate and orient the shape, its dimensions, and whether to center it on the location
Specific global coordinates can be specified by altering the plane

```go
block := cad.MakeBox(cad.TopPlane, width, depth, height, true | false)
```

#### Cylinder ####
Provide a plane to locate and orient the shape and its radius and height. Cylinders are always centered on the plane origin

```go
cylinder := cad.MakeCylinder(cad.TopPlane, radius, height)
```

### Boolean operations ###
Boolean operations allow combining shapes to create more complex features on your model. These operations return a CadOperation from which the resulting shape can be retrieved.

#### Union ####

```go
op, err = cad.Combine(targetShape, makercad.ListOfShape{tools...})
```

#### Difference ####

```go
op, err = cad.Remove(targetShape, makercad.ListOfShape{tools...})
```

### Sketching ###
Sketching allows for creation of more complex 3D shapes by drawing a 2D shape, optionally adding constraints and solving them, then extruding or revolving them to 3D shapes

#### Creating a Sketch ####
A sketch may be created on a plane or a face of a shape:

```go
sketch := cad.Sketch(plane | face)
```

#### Defining Geometry ####

Lines are defined by start and end points

```go
l1 := sketch.Line(startX, startY, endX, endY)
```

Arcs are defined clockwise around a center point

```go
arc1 := sketch.Arc(centerX, centerY, startX, startY, endX, endY)
```

Circles are defined by a center point and a diameter (does not define a constraint)

```go
circ1 := sketch.Circle(centerX, centerY, diameter)
```

#### Constraining Geometry ####
Sometimes it is not easy to determine the exact geometry when defining a sketch. In these cases, let the computer do the work. Define geometry close to what you need and specify constraints to define how the final geometry should relate.

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Coincident(Entity, Entity) | Ensure one entity lies on another entity (eg a point on a line) |
| PointVerticalDistance(*Point, Entity, float64) | Ensures a point is a specific distance along the Y axis from the specified entity |
| PointHorizontalDistance(*Point, Entity, float64) | Ensures a point is a specific distance along the X axis from the specified entity |
| PointProjectedDistance(*Point, Entity, float64) | Ensures that a point's projected distance along the normal of Entity is a specific distance |
| LineMidpoint(*Line, Entity) | Ensures entity is coincident with Line and halfway between its start and end points |
| LineAngle(*Line, *Line, float64) | Ensures the angle between two lines is the specified angle (in radians) |
| ArcLineTangent(*Arc, *Line) | Ensures the specified arc and line are tangent to one another |
| Distance(Entity, Entity, float64) | Ensures the two entities are the specified distance from each other |
| HorizontalLine(*Line) | Ensures the specified line is parallel with the X axis | 
| HorizontalPoints(*Point, *Point) | Ensures the imaginary line segment between the two points specified is parallel with the X axis |
| VerticalLine(*Line) | Ensures the specified line is parallel with the X axis | 
| VerticalPoints(*Point, *Point) | Ensures the imaginary line segment between the two points specified is parallel with the X axis |
| LineLength(*Line, float64) | Ensures the specified line has the indicated length |
| Equal(Entity, Entity) | Ensures the two entities are equal (lines the same length, circles the same diameter, etc) |
| CurveDiameter(Entity, float64) | Ensures the arc or circle specified has the indicated diameter |

Many of these constraints also have convenience functions on an entity. For instance to set a line's length:

```go
line1.Length(10)
```

Most of these convenience functions return the entity so they can be chained:

```go
line1.Length(10).Horizontal()
```

#### Solving Constraints ####
Runs the constraint solver algorithm. Returns an error should it be unable to solve.

```go
err = sketch.Solve()
```

#### Debugging Sketches ####
Sketches can be overconstrained or underconstrained. The OverConstrained method returns a list of constraints that overdefine the problem:

```go
fmt.PrintLn("Over constrained constraints: ", sketch.OverConstrained())
```

An underconstrained sketch will have multiple solutions (often infinite).

A sketch can be converted to an SVG image:

```go
sketch.LogDebug("sketch.svg")
```

The constraint solver uses a graph based approach to simplifying the system of equations that are necessary to solve a sketch. If there is an issue with a sketch, logging the graph can be helpful in determining why:

```go
sketch.ExportImage("sketch.dot")
```

These .dot files can be visualized via GraphViz:
```bash
dot -Tsvg clustered.dot -o clustered.svg
```

#### Extruding or Revolving Sketches ####
First, convert the sketch into a Face:
```go
face1 := makercad.NewFace(sketch)
```

Then it can be extruded or revolved
```go
operation, err := face1.Extrude(distance)
```

```go
operation, err := face1.Revolve(axis, angleInRadians)
```

With either of these, if combining via a boolean operation with an existing shape, it can be done in one step:
```go
operation1, err := face1.ExtrudeMerging(distance, MergeType, makercad.ListOfShape{someOp.Shape()})
operation2, err := face2.ExtrudeMerging(distance, MergeType, makercad.ListOfShape{someOp.Shape()})
```

### Finding a Face or Edge ###
A Shape can return its list of Faces:
```go
shape1.Faces()
```

A Face or list of Faces can return its list of Edges:
```go
face1.Edges()
shape1.Faces().Edges()
```

A list of Faces or Edges can be filtered and sorted:
```go
someOperation.Shape().Faces().Edges().
  IsCircle().
  Matching(func(e *sketcher.Edge) bool {
    return e.CircleRadius() == 5.8/2.
  })
```

Connecting the pieces:
```go
  block := cad.MakeBox(cad.TopPlane, blockWidth, blockWidth, blockHeight, true)

  // Find the top face aligned with Z positive
  faces := block.Faces().AlignedWith(cad.TopPlane)
  faces.SortByZ(true)
  topFace := faces[0]

  sketch := cad.Sketch(topFace)
  circle := sketch.Circle(0, 0, 5)
  circle.Diameter(5)
  circle.Center.Coincident(sketch.Origin())
  err := sketch.Solve()
  if err != nil {
    // do something
  }

  face1 := makercad.NewFace(sketch)
  newBlock, err = face1.ExtrudeMerging(-2, makercad.MergeTypeRemove, makercad.ListOfShape{block})
```

### Saving Results ###
MakerCAD can export to STL or STEP:
```go
exports := makercad.ListOfShape{block}
cad.ExportStl("my-model.stl", exports, makercad.QualityHigh)
cad.ExportStep("my-model.step", exports)
```
